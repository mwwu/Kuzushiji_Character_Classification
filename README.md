# Kuzushiji_Model_Training
Dependencies:
- NumPy
- Keras/Tensorflow backend
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- requests

Note: the KKanji set is incomplete at the moment. Download it yourself via download_data.py because Github won't host the tar

TODO:
- write code to clean the KKanji set and make it into usable input data
- get tensorboard working on every computer
- understand basic model ability and capacity
- define features to be extracted
- find pages to translate, with translated labels
  - figure out a way to get the pages into clean data
    - where does a character begin or end?
